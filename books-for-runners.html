          <h2>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</h2>
          <h3>By Haruki Murakami</h3>
          <p class = 'light-pink'>Iâ€™ve read a few Murakami novels and picked up this book in part because I was curious about his take on non fiction and also, curious about his private passion for running. Over the span of his writing career, this guy has also run over 20 marathons and even an ultramarathon! This book is about how his two passions for running and creative work influence each other. Unlike his other books with more ethereal and surrealist themes, Murakami's running memoir is straightforward and reflective. His writing style between the memoir and his fiction novels are so different, that it's hard to remember that the same author wrote both. After reading this book, I started thinking about how my creative life intersects with my active and running lifestyle. I started thinking about how they each contribute to each other and make be better in both realms.</p>

          <h2>Born to Run</h2>
          <h3>By Christopher McDougall</h3>
          <p class='light-pink'>Of all the books on this list, this book was the one that made me the most proud of being a runner. It inspires you to run with stories about how the sport is about defying your limitations. I recommended this book to so many people who had any inclination towards running medium to long distance races because it is so inspiring and makes you feel so free and well, born to run. Some parts of the book can be corny and or sensationalized, but overall, it is an enormously inspirational book that I would definitely be reading again in the future. I especially recommend this book if you are in a bit of a running rut because after reading it, you'll feel compelled to lace your shoes and get back out there.</p>

          <h2>Can't Hurt Me</h2>
          <h3>By David Goggins</h3>
          <p class='light-pink'> Running is more a mental test than an athletic endeavor. David Goggins is an ultrarunner, navy seal, and triathlete. He talks about how mental perseverance carried him through the toughest challenges in his life, both on and off the running trails. Although I did enjoy this book, I would not recommend it to many people because I think the extreme and intense mentality towards fitness cult and athleticism through suffering can alienate many people. Also, if self-help books is not your cup of te,a I would avoid this book because there were some moments where the book was very corny and oversentimental. My worry is that people who read this will get into self-defeating mindsets if they stumble into roadblocks, they would not know how to move past it. The book does not do a good job with recommending advice to push past your mental blocks. Rather, it is an inspirational story about how one man overcame his mental blocks, even if its findings are not applicable to the average reader.</p>

      <h2> Flexibility</h2>
      <p>With the amount of free resources on the internet, anyone can create a Marathon plan. However, marathon training has taught me the true feat that comes with training: improvisation, adaptability, and early identification of risks. If you get injured, sick, travel, have work commitments, lack motivation, and can‚Äôt run, what is your response?
        As a UX designer and design project manager, I can create the perfect project timeline, but what if users ghost on interviews? What if the client hates all of our ideas? What if a competitor does it better? The best designers identify risks early and proactively adapt the plan.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Time for design podcasts and relaxation</h2>
      <p>I have found this time enormously valuable to catch up on design podcasts. My favorite podcast now is Design Better Podcast. Running outside clears my mind and gives me space to just relax.</p> 
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Reevaluation of ‚ÄúFailure‚Äù</h2>        
      <p>When Im down on my design work I can bounce back quickly, reevaluate my work, and brainstorm new ideas. I owe this resiliency in large part to running- one day you run your personal record, and the next week you injure your foot putting you out for weeks. Do you give up? No. You ice your injuries and strategize how you can prevent injury when you‚Äôre back on the run.</p>			
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Running taught me discipline and perseverence.</h2>
      <p>It taught my about perseverance when things are hard. Running that last 5 miles in a 26 mile marathon, and continuing even when you hurt. What is your self-talk like at this time to remember the long term goal to push you to shop up on that treadmill, during a rainstorm? If you are struggling to find the right design solution, persist- ask people for feedback, brainstorm some more, re-visit your interview recordings. Put in that extra amount of effort to make those buttons perfectly round with the perfect back shadow effect. 
        There is no secret to success. You do not get what you wish for. You get what you work for.</p>
